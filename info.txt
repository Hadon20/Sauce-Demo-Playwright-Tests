Playwright Sauce Demo - Next Learning Steps and Practice Guide
==============================================================

1. Page Object Expansion
------------------------
- Define separate page classes like InventoryPage, CartPage, etc.
- Encapsulate selectors and actions inside each page class.
- Access page classes via PageManager to keep tests clean and reusable.

2. Inventory Page Tests
-----------------------
- Verify all products are listed on the inventory page.
- Test sorting functionality (by name and price).
- Add multiple items to the cart.
- Challenge: Assert that the sorting order actually works (without hardcoding).

3. Cart Interaction
-------------------
- Assert the cart badge number updates correctly after adding/removing items.
- Navigate to the cart page and verify correct items are displayed.
- Remove items and confirm they no longer appear in the cart.
- Create utility methods in CartPage class for readability and reuse.

4. Checkout Flow
----------------
- Automate the multi-step checkout process:
  1. Proceed to checkout page.
  2. Fill in personal information form.
  3. Complete the purchase and verify success.
- Consider validation of required fields and error message handling.

5. Error Handling and Assertions
--------------------------------
- Extend error validations beyond login:
  - Checkout form field validations.
  - Disabled or hidden elements interaction.
- Ensure assertions are precise and meaningful to catch UI issues.

Practice Topics to Explore
--------------------------
- Page Objects:
  How to reduce duplication by encapsulating repeated selectors and actions?

- Dynamic Locators:
  Handling selectors when elements depend on dynamic data (like product names).

- Data-Driven Tests:
  Testing checkout with various user data sets.

- Assertions:
  Validating sort order or UI changes without relying on fixed values.

- Playwright Config Options:
  Setting up useful debugging features like screenshots, videos, and traces.

- Test Organization:
  Organizing smoke tests vs full regression suites effectively.
